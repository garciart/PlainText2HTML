I try to document my work as much as possible, and when I'm done, I usually have to convert all or some of the documentation to HTML. However, I've found that using apps like Word provide me with too much markup; sometimes it's easier to just put in the HTML myself. So, necessity being the mother of invention, I've written a very basic and lightweight text to HTML converter to help me out. Try it out live at  [http://plaintext2html.rgprogramming.com/](http://plaintext2html.rgprogramming.com/ "Plain Text to HTML Converter"); hopefully, it will make your life easier as well.
